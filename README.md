## what is it  
urls I donâ€™t want to forget

A small tool I built for myself.  
Built this to stop hunting the same links again and again â€”  
common datasheets, online tools, fav blogs, useful reads, and random stuff I found helpful.

Everything's stored in a JSON file.  
The site just reads from it. Fast and simple.  
Nothing more. Just saves me time.
